## Overview
Word Seeker is a tool to give users word recommendations according to context. When the user want a word to describe ***sunshine***, it will give out such candidates, ***"bright sunshine", "warm sunshine", "brilliant sunshine"*** , etc. It could also help students learn english. For example, they want to find the right preposition to fill in the incomplete phrase   ***"different ___  them"*** , Word Seeker could supply them with a few candidates and their word frequency in a large corpus(see screenshot above). The more a candidate appears in a large corpus doesn't mean it is the right one, so example sentences are provided as references.

**Datasets:**    
[Google Books](http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html)        
Google Books project contains a large number of publish books which date back from 17 century. It is a very good corpus for frequency-based text search.    
[UMBC WebBase Corpus](https://ebiquity.umbc.edu/blogger/2013/05/01/umbc-webbase-corpus-of-3b-english-words/)    
The UMBC WebBase corpus is a dataset of high quality English paragraphs containing over three billion words derived from the Stanford WebBase projectâ€™s February 2007 Web crawl. This is where example sentences come from.
